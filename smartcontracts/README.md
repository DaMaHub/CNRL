Coding out Thought Experiments in solidity
----------------------------------------------

Idea:  resolving smart contracts addresses for JSONLD - solidity

e.g   bpm.heartchain.org  would resolved to a smartcontract for that datatype.  That contract would then provide a programmable way to traverse or collect data sets of the same type across the network.

How URI solve   IPFS   Ethereum Name Space  SAFE NameSpace etc.
